## Description

Given a set of **distinct** integers, _nums_, return all possible subsets (the power set).

**Note:** The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

For example,  

If **_nums_** = `[1,2,3]`, a solution is:
```
[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]
```
