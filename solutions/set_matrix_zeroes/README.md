## Description

Given a _m_ x _n_ matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in place.

Did you use extra space?  

A straight forward solution using O(_m_*_n_) space is probably a bad idea.  

A simple improvement uses O(_m_ + _n_) space, but still not the best solution.
